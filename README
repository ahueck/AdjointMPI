The AMPI library is used to reverse MPI communication in the context of algorithmic
differentiation (AD). In principal, the reversal may be used for other purposes.

Source Files
----------

/src 				All AMPI library source files.

- ampi_stack.c, 		Simple dynamic C stack. Will be extended to chunk
				management.
- ampi.c, 			core adjoint MPI routines. All source transformation
  				interfaces access these forward and backward routines.
- ampi_tape.c, 			Generic AMPI tape to integrated into AD overloading
				tools. It works for all tools that use a hash (pointer,
				tape index,...) to link value and adjoint.

/include 			All AMPI library header files.

Interface Files
----------
/interfaces 			AD Tool interfaces. They are not part of the AMPI library
				and should be considered as integration examples for
				other AD Tools.

- ampi_fortran_interface.F90    COMPAD Fortran interface. It integrates the generic AMPI
  ampi_fortran_stubs.c		tape into the COMPAD overloading tape.
  ampi_fortran_stubs.h

- dcc_alloc.cpp			Adjoint dynamic memory management for source 
  dcc_alloc.hpp  		transformation based second order AD in dcc. 

- dcc_mpi.cpp			Source transformation based second order forward over
  dcc_mpi.hpp			reverse AMPI interface.

- dco_tape.cpp		    	dco overloading tape with AMPI generic tape
  				interface.	
  dco_tape.hpp

Examples
----------

The examples use a certain interface to run a test case of the AMPI library. Only
the dco tape is currently distributed for testing purposes. As such only these examples
work without having some AD tool installed.

Additionally you will find some dcc test cases which will need a working dcc compiler in
your $PATH.
